# Getting and cleaning data course project for castanhell

Hello, this repository contains my submission for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" subject, from coursera.

To reduce your time, this document is organized in sessions, which are:

1. How the folders are organized.
2. How the *run_analysis.R* script works and how should you run it (If you are a rigid evaluator).
3. How the code book was made (Just in case).

## How the folders are organized

In this folders you will find:

* The tidy dataset obtained from the course page
* The *run_analysis.R* file containing the script for this Course Project
* The Codebook for the script, at the *CodeBook.md* file.

## The *run_analysis.R* script

## The code book

Kind regards,
